## 🧠 Core Design Principle (Critical)

The system is built around an **internal projection model (source of truth)**:

- The schema is parsed into an internal structured representation
- All manipulations operate ONLY on this projection via **Command** objects
- UI rendering reads from this projection
- Export reconstructs schema from the projection

### Architecture: Hybrid Functional/Mutable

- **Projection** is a mutable container (node map + root ID)
- **Commands** are pure factory functions: `func(projection, params) -> (Command, error)`
- **Command** holds `Do()` and `Undo()` closures that mutate projection in-place
- **Access** to projection is through pure getter functions
- **Bubbletea Model.Update()** calls `cmd.Do()` and returns updated model

### ✅ Implications

- Decouples UI from schema format
- Enables support for multiple formats (future)
- Enables safe transformations and undo/redo
- Simplifies validation pipeline addition later
- Commands are unit-testable without TUI
- No full-tree copy per mutation (performant for large schemas)

---

## 📌 Assumptions

- Schema size is small to medium (interactive use)
- User is a developer comfortable with terminal tools
- Validation is not required initially (extensible placeholder needed)
- Single-user local workflow

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### Core (v1)

- Open / import schema files
- Save / export schema files
- Tree-based navigation
- Field editing
- Add / remove / move / duplicate fields
- Undo / redo
- Basic search

### Advanced (v2+)

- Schema registry integration (as source and sink)
- Tree folding and markers
- Advanced search
- Multi-selection and bulk edit
- Custom theming

## 🧭 UX / UI Model

### Layout (4 panels)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Status: mode indicator, schema name, help hints]   │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────┤
│                  │                  │               │
│  Schema Tree     │  Node Details    │ File Explorer │
│  (left panel)    │  (center panel)  │ (right, stub) │
│                  │                  │               │
├──────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────┤
│ [Command/Search bar + stats: fields, depth, undo]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Left panel: schema tree (primary focus)
- Center panel: node details / editing
- Right panel: file explorer (placeholder in v1)
- Top: status bar (mode, schema name)
- Bottom: command/search input + statistics

### Modes

| Mode    | Activation              | Purpose                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Normal  | Default / `Esc`         | Tree navigation, actions                |
| Edit    | `Enter` on detail field | Modify node attributes                  |
| Search  | `/`                     | Filter and navigate matches             |
| Command | `:`                     | Extended commands (save, export, theme) |

### Interaction Principles

- Keyboard-first navigation
- Vim-like bindings (j/k/h/l, g/G, /, :, etc.)
- Mode-based interaction (Normal → Edit → Search → Command)
- Visual feedback for current mode and focused element

### Core Layers

1. **Input Layer** (`io/`)
   - Parse .avsc files from disk or CLI args
   - Future: schema registry client

2. **Projection Layer** (`projection/`)
   - Internal tree representation
   - Source of truth for all operations
   - Node kinds: schema, record, field, primitive, named, union, array, map, enum, fixed

3. **Transformation Layer** (`command/`)
   - Pure command factories
   - Undo/redo history stack (500 deep)
   - Each command: Do() + Undo() + Description

4. **Rendering Layer** (`model/`)
   - Bubbletea models per panel
   - Reads projection, dispatches commands
   - Mode-aware key handling

5. **Output Layer** (`io/`)
   - Serialize projection → Avro JSON
   - Write to file or clipboard

- Avoiding UI clutter
- Registry integration complexity

---

## 🚀 Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Logic, No UI) ✅

- Go module init + dependencies (bubbletea, lipgloss, testify)
- All `projection/`, `command/`, `search/`, `schema/`, `io/` packages
- Full unit test coverage
- Proves the engine works without any TUI code

### Phase 2: TUI Shell (Layout + Navigation) ✅

- Entry point with CLI arg parsing
- 4-panel layout with bubbletea/lipgloss
- Tree rendering from projection
- Normal mode navigation (j/k/h/l/g/G/Space/Enter)
- Default dark theme

### Phase 3: Edit Mode + Actions ✅

- Detail panel with editable fields
- All mutation actions wired (add/delete/copy/move/replace)
- Undo/redo integration
- Status bar shows history depth

### Phase 4: Search + Command Mode ✅

- Search input with fuzzy matching
- Prefix filters (n:, t:, p:, ns:, a:)
- Command mode (:w, :q, :export, :theme)
- File picker for opening new schemas

### Phase 5: Theming + Config ✅

- JSON theme files (migrated from TOML)
- 10 built-in themes (dark, light, monokai, catppuccin-mocha, tokyo-night, rose-pine, dracula, gruvbox, one-dark-pro, vscode-light)
- Runtime switching via `:theme` command
- Config at `~/.config/avedit/config.json`
- Theme persistence (saved on switch)

### Phase 6: Polish ✅

- README with installation, usage, keybindings, config samples
- Config file discovery (cwd → executable → ~/.config)
- Sample config and theme files

### Phase 7: File Explorer ✅

- File explorer pane (left of tree)
- Toggle visibility with Ctrl+E
- Recursive file search with auto-expand
- Directory navigation (parent, set-root)
- Open .avsc files from explorer

### Phase 8: Advanced Polish ✅

- Command history (↑/↓ arrows in command mode)
- Search history (↑/↓ arrows in search mode)
- Persistent history saved to `~/.config/avedit/history.json`
- Unsaved changes confirmation on quit and load
- Named type rename propagation
- Alias rename propagation
- Categorized type picker (Primitives/Complex/Named/Aliases)
- Type picker filter mode (/)
- Responsive status bar with proportional truncation

### Phase 9: Security + Feedback ✅

- Removed confirmation from field delete (direct action)
- Added confirmation for quit-with-unsaved and load-if-unsaved
- Notification system (flash messages + scrollable history)
- Help overlay with scrolling (j/k, ?/Esc to toggle)
- File path resolution fixed (saves relative to explorer root)

### Phase 10: Distribution ✅

- goreleaser configuration (.goreleaser.yaml)
- Homebrew tap + Scoop bucket setup
- Pre-built binaries via GitHub releases
- README with installation instructions for all platforms

### Phase 11: Documentation ✅ (Current)

- Architecture documentation (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - High-level flow and patterns
  - Mermaid architecture diagram + state machine
  - Low-level code references with line numbers
- Updated code comments matching documentation
- Updated README with "How It Works", search prefixes, tips
- Sample config files (config.json, theme, history)

## Improvements to Add (priority order)

| # | Feature | LoC estimate | Time estimate | Status |
|---|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Schema Registry integration — confluent-compatible pull/push/compatibility-check | ~1500-2000 | 16-24h | pending |
| 2 | Schema validation — warn on invalid defaults, duplicate names, circular refs | ~300-400 | 4-6h | pending |
| 3 | GIF/screenshot in README — critical for GitHub discovery | 0 (media) | 1-2h | manual |
| 4 | Diff view — show what changed since last save (`:diff` command) | ~300-400 | 4-5h | pending |
| 5 | awesome-go listing — free discoverability to 130K+ stars audience | 0 (PR) | 30min | pending |
