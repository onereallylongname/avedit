# Key Takeaways

- Binary size and runtime overhead are effectively equivalent.
- Primary differences are in code complexity and architectural structure.
- Cobra introduces more boilerplate but supports scaling and ecosystem integration.
- Kong minimizes code and abstraction but requires manual structuring for complex CLIs.
